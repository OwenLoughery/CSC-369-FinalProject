## Question:

How do software update strategies (frequency, size, and timing) influence long-term user engagement and app success in mobile app marketplaces?

## Why is this question worth answering:

I found this question interesting due to its real life practicality. All app and mobile game developers need to know how to successfully keep their app popular and engaging so looking into this could be really interesting to see if I can find the cause of this.

## Hypothesis:

Apps that maintain consistent and frequent update cycles that also respond quickly to user reported issues will show:

1. Higher average ratings over time

2. Slower rating decay (less drop-off after launch hype)

3. Longer lifespan before user interest declines

4. Higher review volume growth which indicates a constant engagement

Meanwhile, apps with:

1. Infrequent updates

2. Long bug-fix delays

3. To many updates

will show sharper rating declines and engagement drops.

This is because I would say frequent updates signal active maintenance, improve performance, and respond to user feedback which in return gives better user trust and retention.

## Data

For this I found at https://github.com/facundoolano/google-play-scraper

You can collect for hundreds of thousands of apps:

- App ID

- Category

- Update dates

- Version history

- Ratings over time

- Review counts

- Install ranges

- Changelog text

So I should be able to easily pull data across many categories to exceed 15GB of data as these categories should be massive amounts of data on their own.

**Need some help figuring out how to use the web scraper so don't have data actually downloaded yet but going to ask in class next time sorry!**
