## Question:

How does player sentiment toward video games change over time, and is there evidence that game developers improve player satisfaction following periods of negative feedback?

## Why is this question worth answering:

I found this question interesting because modern video games are continuously updated and improved based on community feedback through patches, balance changes, and content updates. Understanding how player sentiment evolves over time provides insight into player engagement, developer responsiveness, and the lifecycle of live-service and continuously supported games. This topic is also widely discussed in gaming communities where players frequently debate whether developers “fix” games after negative reception (for example, games that launch with criticism but improve through updates).

## Hypothesis:

Player sentiment toward games will generally improve over time, particularly after periods of increased negative feedback. This is because developers often respond to player criticism with updates and improvements, which can lead to higher long-term satisfaction and more positive reviews as the game matures. For games that don't update and listen to feedback will lose engagement and people will stop playing.

## Data

I found the data I am using at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kieranpoc/steam-reviews

The dataset used for my analysis is a large scale Steam Reviews dataset (~40GB in original CSV format), containing over 100 million user reviews. The dataset includes important variables such as review timestamps, recommendation status (positive or negative), playtime metrics, weighted voting score (helpfulness score that is steam generated), and engagement indicators (votes and comments).
